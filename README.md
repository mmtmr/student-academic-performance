# Student Academic Performance Analysis
This dataset contains the three-year final scores of degree students marks at the end of their academic programs with several features that might or might not impact the outcome of these students’ performance. It includes their personal details, academic performance, family backgrounds and daily routines. And need to analyse how these factors influence their academic performance. This dataset contains 33 columns with 16 integer datatype values,9 string values and 8 boolean values.

## Analyses
### Does the final score of each student remain stable throughout every period?
1. Find the distribution of G1, G2, and G3.
2. Find the relationship between G1, G2, and G3.
3. Exploration and Assumption
###	What are the differences between drop out students and non-drop out students?
1. Find drop out and non-drop out percentage of students.
2. Find and compare the correlation matrix of both.
3. Find and compare the summary statistics of both.
4. Find the relationship between binary variables and dropout.
5. Find the relationship between binary variables and dropout period.
6. Find the relationship between categorical variables and dropout.
7. Find the relationship between categorical variables and dropout period.
### What affects the score in first period, second period, final, and their average?	
1. Find the difference of how variables affect score between student dropout and non-dropouts.
2. Find the relationship between categorical variables and grades.
3. Find the relationship between numeric variables and grades.
### What affects the difference of scores?
1. Find the difference of how variables affect difference of scores between student overall and non-dropouts.
2. Find the relationship between categorical variables and difference of scores.
3. Find the relationship between numeric variables and difference of scores.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis on dropouts, grades, and improvement, several conclusions can be made:
1. Having extra paid class, wants to take higher education and not having romantic relationship helps to avoid dropout. Age, failures, mother’s job also caused dropouts.
2. The three variables that affect grade the most are failures, mother’s education, and mother’s job. Mother and father’s education level, mother’s occupation in health, fater’s occupation is teacher or at home, study time, internet all positively contributed to the average grade. While failures, absences, weekly or daily alcohol consumptions negatively affect the average grade.
3. The three variables that affect difference of grades the most age, weekly alcohol consumption, and address. Weekly alcohol consumption of 5 and travel time, and limitation of free time make more improvement while age. The increase of age negatively causes the marks to decrease.
